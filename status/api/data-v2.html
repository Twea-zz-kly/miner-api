{killSwitchText="There is an important update available for Mobile Miner which, among other things, fixes all the issues with ads loading. Please be aware that the new update has a different package name, so will be treated as a different app by your device and it will appear that you have 2 identical apps installed if you don't delete the old version. Therefore you should delete the current version before downloading the new one to avoid confusion. The update is available now at http://miner.tweakly.net/download"}
